<h2 id="tnwe">The Not Whole Enchilada</h2>
<p>Over our last 2 trips we haven’t taken the opportunity to do The Whole Enchilada. At this time of year it isn’t fully open but it likely will be from LPS down. However that’s mostly downhill and not much of a challenge. However an option exists to make to akin to a Crested Butte ride we do where we front load a big climb to earn the downhill. As such here is a possible route. Open the map link then read the description below it and you will see what I'm seeing.</p>
<p><strong>Raptor Route - Eagle Eye, Hawks Glide, Falcon Flow Mountain Biking Route | Trailforks</strong></p>
<p>We’ll start from the Slickrock Trailhead on Sand Flats Road and make our way up to LPS without using a shuttle. The route connects a series of legal, climbable singletrack trails that are scenic and much more enjoyable than riding up the road. From the parking lot, we’ll take Fins & Things for a short stretch and then turn onto Kestrel Run, which steadily climbs and connects us to the Raptor Route. This includes Falcon, Hawk, and Eagle trails—originally designed for descending, but they climb surprisingly well. It’s a mix of packed dirt, slickrock, and some tight switchbacks through piñon and juniper terrain. There’s enough variation to keep it interesting, and the views open up as we gain elevation. After about 10 miles of climbing and ~2,400 feet of ascent, we hit Sand Flats Road for a final push—just over a mile of road riding—to reach the LPS trailhead, which is the highest open section of the Whole Enchilada in spring. From there, it’s a full descent: LPS, into the Porcupine Rim jeep trail, and then the Porcupine singletrack that winds along the cliffs above the Colorado River. This part is classic Moab—fast, exposed, and raw. The ride finishes right near the river on Highway 128.</p>
